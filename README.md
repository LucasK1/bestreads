## Bestreads

To implement:
* ~~Working search~~
* ~~Users~~
* ~~User shelf~~
* Searchbar animation when submitted
* Book information when hovered
* To-read, read and want to read checkboxes
* Error component
* Optimzing the book component so it gets book data from the redux store, not from the API

Bugs:
* Have to refresh after logging in to add a book to the shelf (??)
